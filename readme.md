## Python Next Steps: Functions and Scripting

July 15 and 17, 9 am to 12 pm <br>


## Prep

It is assumed that you have some experience in Python, for example from taking an introductory workshop or class, or from completing a tutorial.

We will be using a text editor, interactive Python interpreter, and a command line shell.

I like Jupyter Lab, as it has all three components built in and is included in Anaconda. However, you should use what you are comfortable with.

You will also need a copy of this repository. See [these instructions](https://sites.northwestern.edu/summerworkshops/resources/downloading-from-github/) for how to download the files in this repository.
